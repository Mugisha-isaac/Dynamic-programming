# Time complexity for howSum function

   m = target sum
   n = number
   time = o(n^m*m)

# Space complexity

  space = o(m)


# Memoized howSum algorith

  time = 0(n*m^2)

  space = 0(m^2)


# Time complexity for bestSum algorithm

m  = target sum
n = numbers
time = o(n^m*m)
space = o(m^2)

# Memoized complexity for bestSum algorithm

  time = o(m^2*n)
  space = o(m^2)


# Time complexity for canConstruct algorthim

 m = target.length
 n= wordbank.length
 
 time = o(n^m)
 space =o(m^2)


# Memoized complexity for canConstruct algorithm

 m = target.length
 n = wordbank.length

 time = n*m^2
 space = o(m^2)


 # Time and space complexity for brute force canConstruct algorith

  m = target.length
 n= wordbank.length
 
 time = o(n^m)
 space =o(m^2)


 # Time and space complexity of optimised canConstruct algorithm
   
 m = target.length
 n = wordbank.length

 time = n*m^2
 space = o(m^2)

 # Time and space complexity of brute allConstruct algorithm
 m = target.length
 n = wordbank.length

 time = n*m^2
 space = o(m^2)
 
 # Time and space complexity of optimised  allConstruct algorithm

m= target.length
 n=wordBank.length

 time = o(n^m)
 space = o(m)
